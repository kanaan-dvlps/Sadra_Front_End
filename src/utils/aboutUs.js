        Since 2001 the SpineCorporation has significantly advanced SpineCor technology, expanding its use in the treatment of scoliosis in both children and adults. Additionally, some of the core principles and clinical experience have led to the development of new devices used for the treatment of pelvic girdle pain and a greater range of degenerative spinal disorders.
